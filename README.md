# NBA-Rookie-Analysis
In this investigation i examined NBA rookie data to forecast the probability that players will stay in the league 
for a minimum of five years. My target variable is appointed as 'TARGET_5Yrs'. The goal of this 
investigation is to build models that represent the correlations between independent variables and the 
likelihood of completing this five-year term by using logistic regression, gaussianNB and neural network
algorithms and to deduce the best method. The phases involved fetching data, data preprocessing, 
exploration, model building, evaluation, visualization, and analysis.
